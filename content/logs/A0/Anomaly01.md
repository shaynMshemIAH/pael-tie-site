# Anomaly A0-01: Subatomic Activation Without VCC

**Field**: FieldA  
**Sensor**: Grove GSR Sensor  
**Event Type**: Subatomic Sensor Activation Anomaly  
**Status**: 🟡 *Preliminary Release*  

---

## 📽️ Captured Frame

![Anomaly A0-01 Frame](/assets/images/Anomaly_A0-01_Frame)

> **Note**: This frame was captured during a live GSR test with **no VCC (red wire) connected**. Despite lacking a traditional power connection, the sensor **returned active readings**.

---

## 🧪 Hypothesis

Subatomic CF energy, originating from brainwave intention and crossing through Bwemc², can power or trigger responses in a sensor **without physical circuit closure**.

---

## ⚙️ Method

- Grove GSR sensor connected without VCC (red wire).
- FieldA active and synced.
- GSR values recorded live via logging script.
- Laser and Lux anomalies noted but not documented in this specific test.

---

## 📊 Result Summary

- Sensor activated.
- Returned valid signal values.
- Frame captured at ~3s showing operational status despite lack of circuit power.
- Validates CF-initiated subatomic response.

## 🔁 Interpretation

This confirms that the system can respond across LdD live/unlive states without relying on standard voltage. Energy **traversed subatomically** through BWemc² and **activated the hardware from the Field layer**, not the GPIO layer.

---

## 🔮 Forward Context

This anomaly marks the **first flicker** of a new paradigm. A full, professional, and multi-sensor context — including RTC, Lux, and Thermal — will be uploaded in the near future as part of `A0-RTCAI`.

> **Status**: This is the *preliminary documentation*. A more advanced, final context will be released once surrounding FieldMI sequence logs are completed.
