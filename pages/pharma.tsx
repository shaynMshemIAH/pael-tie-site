      <p>
        Already, page documented biological results of subatomic energy disbursal across time Fields A, 0, B, and MI — focused on cellular regeneration and decay reversal.
      </p>

      <h2 style={{ marginTop: '2rem' }}>Key Test Areas</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Hair regeneration and LdD detection</li>
        <li>Blood particle restructuring under UV/IV photonic exposure</li>
        <li>Skin and nail decay under FieldB vs. FieldMI transformation</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 style={{ marginTop: '2rem' }}>Method</h2>
      <p>
        Tests used ammonia/ammonium subatomic interactions across photon and field exposure. Rehydration, aging control, and DH/TIH light conversion were documented with anomaly flurry distribution.
      </p>

      <h2 style={{ marginTop: '2rem' }}>Patent Bridge</h2>
      <p>
        The ammonia bridge allows enthalpy restructuring of DH states toward TIH by LdD sequence traversal. Each result logged here reflects a successful Leaf_PLT proof.
